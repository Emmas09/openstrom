OpenStrom is an Open Hardware device that can measure and control power circuits over the internet.

It is developed by the [OpenStrom KG](http://www.openstrom.com) and generously supported by [netidee](http://www.netidee.at).

We are currently refining the specification and experiment with different components for the prototype. Our current goal is to launch a Kickstarter campaign once we have finallized the prototype and then manufacture our first batch.

if you are interested in helping with development or if you think you have some interesting use cases that we should consider, please get in touch with [Matthias](mailto:m.zeitler@openstrom.com "Matthias Zeitler").
